        <description>Imoprting modules System libraries This is how including other libraries works, for example include fmt module from standard library:
use fmt: mod[std] = {fmt}; def main: mod[init] = { fmt::log.warn(&amp;quot;Last warning!...&amp;quot;) } To use only the log namespace of fmt module:
use log mod[std] = {fmt::log}; def main: mod[init] = { pro[] main: int = { log.warn(&amp;quot;Last warning!...&amp;quot;) } } But let&amp;rsquo;s say you only wanna use ONLY the warn functionality of log namespace from fmt module:</description>

        <description>Build-in functions Fol has some build-in functions offered by compiler, and you access them by . (with space/newline/bracket before):
var contPoint: ptr[int] = 10;	// make a pointer and asign the memory to value of 10 .print(.pointer_value(contPoint));	// print the dereferenced value of pointer Macro system are a very complicated system, and yet can be used as simply as in-place replacement. A lot of build-in macros exist in the language to make the code more easy to type.</description>

        <description>Every file in a folder is part of one package, thus they share the same scope. Thus two varibles with same name at global scope cant be defined. However, this is kind of special for functions. Functions of the same name and same amount of parameters (so identical functions, not function overloading) can be defined in two different files. When called, the one on the same file is used.
In case a function exists in two files and is called from thrid one, then this can be resolved in two ways.</description>

        <description>At least two linguistic mechanisms are necessary to make the computations in programs flexible and powerful: some means of selecting among alternative control flow paths (of statement execution) and some means of causing the repeated execution of statements or sequences of statements. Statements that provide these kinds of capabilities are called control statements. A control structure is a control statement and the collection of statements whose execution it controls. This set of statements is in turn generally structured as a block, which in addition to grouping, also defines a lexical scope.</description>

        <description>Every value in Fol is of a certain data type, which tells Fol what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. There are four main subsets: simple, container, complex and special.
Simple Simple types are the most primitive type of data:
int[options], flt[options], chr[options], bol Intiger type An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer of the u32 type, the type declaration indicates that the value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i, instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space:</description>

        <description>Namespaces A namespace can be defined in three ways:
 in a subfolder same folder, but in a new file or the same file  and is done by using slash when outside the main module
def shko/other: mod[] = { pro[] main: int = { // implementation } // implementation } or in the same module file:
def shko: mod[] = { pro[] main: int = { // implementation } def shko/other: mod[] = { // implementation } } Blocks Block statement is used for scopes where members get destroyed when scope is finished.</description>

        <description>Stack vs Heap The Stack What is the stack? It&amp;rsquo;s a special region of your computer&amp;rsquo;s memory that stores temporary variables created by each function (including the main() function). The stack is a &amp;ldquo;LIFO&amp;rdquo; (last in, first out) data structure, that is managed and optimized by the CPU quite closely. Every time a function declares a new variable, it is &amp;ldquo;pushed&amp;rdquo; onto the stack. Then every time a function exits, all of the variables pushed onto the stack by that function, are freed (that is to say, they are deleted).</description>

        <description>A subprogram definition describes the interface to and the actions of the subprogram abstraction. A subprogram call is the explicit request that a specific subprogram be executed. A subprogram is said to be active if, after having been called, it has begun execution but has not yet completed that execution.A subprogram declaration consists of an identifier, zero or more argument parameters, a return value type and a block of code.</description>

        <description>Unlike other programming languages, FOL does not have exceptions (Rust neither). It has only two types of errors:
 braking errors recoverable errors  Breaking errors cause a program to fail abruptly. A program cannot revert to its normal state if an unrecoverable error occurs. It cannot retry the failed operation or undo the error. An example of an unrecoverable error is trying to access a location beyond the end of an array.</description>

        <description>Piping is a process that connects the output of the expression to the left to the input of the expression of the right. You can think of it as a dedicated program that takes care of copying everything that one expressionm prints, and feeding it to the next expression. The idea is the same as bash pipes. For example, an subprogram output is piped to a conditional through pipe symbol | then the conditional takes the input and returns true or false.</description>

        <description>Concurrency Concurrency is the ability of different tasks of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent tasks, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the decomposability property of a program into order-independent or partially-ordered tasks.
There are two distinct categories of concurrent task control.</description>

        <description>Constructs are the way to declare new type of data. A construct binds an identifier, the type name, to a type.
There re two ways to declare new constructs:
 alias declarations and type definitions  Alias declaration An alias declaration binds an identifier to the given type. All the properties of the type are bound to the alias too: credit to golang:
typ[pub] I5: arr[int, 5]; So now the in the code, instead of writing arr[int, 5] we could use I5:</description>

        <description>A type declaration binds an identifier, the type name, to a type. Type declarations come in two forms:
 alias declarations and type definitions (objects): records, enums, units and classes.  Alias declaration An alias declaration binds an identifier to the given type. All the properties of the type are bound to the alias too: credit to golang:

        <description>Generic functions - lifting The generic programming process focuses on finding commonality among similar implementations of the same algorithm, then providing suitable abstractions so that a single, generic algorithm can cover many concrete implementations. This process, called lifting, is repeated until the generic algorithm has reached a suitable level of abstraction, where it provides maximal reusability while still yielding efficient, concrete implementations. The abstractions themselves are expressed as requirements on the parameters to the generic algorithm.</description>

        <description>Generics allow us to write a class or method that can work with any data types. Here there is a method that returns the bigger number of two.
pro max(T: gen)(a, b: T): T { result = a | a &amp;lt; b | b; }; fun biggerFloat(a, b: flt[32]) flt[32] { return max(flt[32])(a, b); }; fun biggerInteger(a, b: int[64]) int[64] { return max(int[64])(a, b); }; And here is an object defined with generics.</description>

        <description>Statements The actions that a program takes are expressed in statements. Common actions include declaring variables, assigning values, calling subprograms, looping through collections, and branching to one or another block of code, depending on a given condition. The order in which statements are executed in a program is called the flow of control or flow of execution. The flow of control may vary every time that a program is run, depending on how the program reacts to input that it receives at run time.</description>

        <description>WITH BUILD-INS, ALTERNATIVES, MACROS, DEFAULTS AND TEMPLATES, YOU CAN COMPLETELY MAKE A NEW TYPESYSTEM, WITH ITS OWN KEYWORDS, IDENTIFIERS, AND BEHAVIOUR.
 IT IS NOT SUGGESTED TO RELAY HEAVILY ON MACROS BECAUSE THE CODE MIGHT LOOSES THE READABILITY WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO USE YOUR CODE.
 Fol has many build-in functions and macros offered by compiler, and you access them by . (with space/newline/bracket before):
var contPoint: ptr[int] = 10;	// make a pointer and asign the memory to value of 10 .</description>

        <description>Simple types are the most primitive type of data:
int[options], flt[options], chr[options], bol Intiger type An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer of the u32 type, the type declaration indicates that the value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i, instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space:
var aVar: int[u32] = 45; Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.</description>

        <description>In fol, every calcultaion, needs to be enclosed in rounded brackets ( //to evaluate ) - except in one line evaluating, the curly brackets are allowed too { // to evaluate }:
fun adder(a, b: int): int = { retun a + b // this will throw an error } fun adder(a, b: int): int = { retun (a + b) // this is the right way to enclose } Order of evaluation is strictly left-to-right, inside-out as it is typical for most others imperative programming languages:</description>

        <description>Containers are of compound types. They contain other primitive or constructed types. To access the types in container those brackets are used: [], so:
var container: type = { element, element, element } // declaring a container var varable: type = container[2] // accessing the last element Containers are always zero indexed
 Static Arrays Arrays arr[type,size] Arrays are the most simple type of container. They contain homogeneous type, meaning that each element in the array has the same type.</description>

        <description>Encoding Identifiers in FOL can be any string of letters, digits and underscores, but beginning with a letter. Two immediate following underscores __ are not allowed.
IDENTIFIER:
[a-z A-Z] [a-z A-Z 0-9 _]* | _ [a-z A-Z 0-9 _]+
 An identifier is any nonempty ASCII string of the following form:
Either
 The first character is a letter. The remaining characters are alphanumeric or _.  Or

        <description>Are a very complicated system, and yet can be used as simply as in-place replacement. A lot of build-in macros exist in the language to make the code more easy to type. Below are some system defined macros.
For example, wherever $ is before any variable name, its replaced with .to_string. Or wherever ! is before bol name, its replaced with .not but when the same ! is placed before ptr it is replaced with .</description>

        <description>Alternatives are used when we want to simplify code. For example, define an alternative, so whenever you write +var it is the same as var[+].
def &#39;+var&#39;: alt = &#39;var[+]&#39; def &#39;~var&#39;: alt = &#39;var[~]&#39; def &#39;.pointer_content&#39;: alt = &#39;.pointer_value&#39; </description>

        <description>Defaults are a way to change the default behaviour of options. Example the default behaviour of str when called without options. By defalt str is it is saved on stack, it is a constant and not public, thus has str[pil,imu,nor], and we want to make it mutable and saved on heap by default:
def &#39;str&#39;: def[] = &#39;str[new,mut,nor]&#39; </description>

        <description>Normal comments Comments in FOL code follow the general Rust/C++ style of line (//) and block (/* ... */) comment forms and are interpreted as a form of whitespace.
LINE_COMMENT :
// (~[/ !] | //) ~\n* | //
BLOCK_COMMENT :
/* (~[* !] ) ( ~*/)* */ | /**/

        <description>A literal expression consists of one or more of the numerical/letter forms described earlier. It directly describes a numbers, characters, booleans, containers and constructs.
There are two type of literals:
 values calls  Value literals Value literals are the simpliest expressions. They are direct values assigned to variables and are divided into two types:
 singletons clusters  Singelton literals Singleton literals represent one sigle values:
4 // intiger literal 0xA8 // hex-intiger literal 4.</description>

        <description>Templates are supposed to be mostly used for operator overloading. They are glorified functions, hence used with pro or fun instead of def.
For example here is how the != is defined:
fun &#39;!=&#39;(a, b: int): bol = { return .not(.eq(a, b)) } .assert( 5 != 4 ) or define $ to return the string version of an object (careful, it is object$ and not $object, the latest is a macro, not a template):</description>

        <description>A number is either an integer, floating-point or imaginary. The grammar for recognizing the kind of number is mixed.
Intigers An integer has one of four forms:
 A decimal literal starts with a decimal digit and continues with any mixture of decimal digits and underscores. A hex literal starts with the character sequence U+0030 U+0078 (0x) and continues as any mixture (with at least one digit) of hex digits and underscores.</description>

= + - * / &amp;gt; . @ $ ~ &amp;amp; % &amp;lt; : ! ? ^ # ` \ _ The grammar uses the terminal OP to refer to operator symbols as defined here.
Brackets Bracket punctuation is used in various parts of the grammar. An open bracket must always be paired with a close bracket.</description>
