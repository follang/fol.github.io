        <description>Concurrency Concurrency is the ability of different tasks of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent tasks, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the decomposability property of a program into order-independent or partially-ordered tasks.
There are two distinct categories of concurrent task control.</description>
